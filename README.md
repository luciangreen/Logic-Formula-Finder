# Logic-Formula-Finder
Finds formulas with and, or and not from data.

* logic_ff1.pl

# Getting Started

Please read the following instructions on how to install the project on your computer for finding logical formulas.

# Prerequisites

* Install <a href="https://www.swi-prolog.org/build/">SWI-Prolog</a> for your machine.

# Installation from List Prolog Package Manager (LPPM)

* Optionally, you can install from LPPM by installing <a href="https://www.swi-prolog.org/build/">SWI-Prolog</a> for your machine, downloading the <a href="https://github.com/luciangreen/List-Prolog-Package-Manager">LPPM Repository</a>, loading LPPM with `['lppm'].` then installing the package by running `lppm_install("luciangreen","Logic-Formula-Finder").`.

# Installing and Logic Formula Finder

* Install by downloading the prerequisites above and saving in folders next to each other or by using LPPM above.
* Run swipl
* Load with ['logic_ff1.pl'].
* In swipl, run with: 
```
?- logic_ff1([[a, true],[b,false],[c,true],[d,false]],[[a,ÃŸtrue],[b,false],[c,true],[d,false]], [true],F).
```
to find formulae with a=true, b=false, c=true with a result true and some results:
```
F = [[[a, or, d], and, c], or, b] ;
F = [[a, and, [c, or, d]], or, b] ;
F = [[a, and, c], or, [b, and, d]] ;
F = [[a, and, c], or, [b, or, d]] ;
F = [not, d] ;
.
.
.
